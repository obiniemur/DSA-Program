HOW TO DETERMINE THE FIRST DIGIT IN A NUMBER?

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{

    int num;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    int mainNum = num / 1000;
    if(mainNum % 2 == 0){
        printf("EVEN");
    }else{
        printf("ODD");
    }
    return 0;
}


*********************************************Key questions regarding the above code (focus on the input; they require a 4-digit input)***************************************

Given a number X. Print "EVEN" if the first digit of X is an even number. Otherwise, print "ODD".

For instance: In 4569, the first digit is 4, the second digit is 5, the third digit is 6, and the fourth digit is 9.

Input
Only one line containing a number X (999 < X â‰¤ 9999)

Output
If the first digit is even, print "EVEN"; otherwise, print "ODD".



*********************************
To identify a digit, we must always examine the input.
If there are 4 digits, we can divide the entire number by 1000 to eliminate the last 3 digits. We can divide by 100 to remove the last two digits, and we can divide by 10 to discard the last digit.
